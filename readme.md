INTRODUCTION
---------------

There are a few different plugins for consuming SOAP web services with grails, but none currently deal with the issue of caching port references.  The ws-client plugin works, but its limitations are in how it creates and consumes the wsdl.  It relies on real time creation of proxy classes and services which can be very processor and memory (time) consuming with a large or complex service contract.  We need a way to speed up service invocation so this plugin was created to facilitate that need when consuming SOAP services using cxf.

The Cxf Client plugin will allow you to use existing (or new) apache cxf wsdl2java generated content and cache the port reference to speed up your soap service end point invocations through an easy configuration driven mechanism.

WsdlToJava Command
---------------

This plugin provides a convenient way to run wsdl2java as a grails run target in your project.

You will need to put this plugin as a standard dependency AND a classpath dependency as follows

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        grailsVersion = project.grailsVersion
    }
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        maven { url "https://repo.grails.org/grails/core" }
        maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/ctoestreich/grails-plugins" } //Required until grails repo is fixed
    }
    dependencies {
        //other stuff
        classpath "org.grails.plugins:grails-cxf-client:3.0.3" //This line
    }
}

dependencies {
    //other stuff
    compile 'org.grails.plugins:grails-cxf-client:3.0.3' //This line
}
```

First point the configured clients to a wsdl (either locally or remotely).  This is done by adding the [wsdl] node to the client config as following:

```groovy
cxf {
    client {
        simpleServiceClient {
            //used in wsdl2java
            wsdl = "docs/SimpleService.wsdl" //only used for wsdl2java script target
            namespace = "cxf.client.demo.simple"
            client = false //defaults to false
            bindingFile = "grails-app/conf/bindings.xml"
            outputDir = "src/java"
            allowChunking = true //false

            //used for invoking service
            clientInterface = cxf.client.demo.simple.SimpleServicePortType
            serviceEndpointAddress = "${service.simple.url}"
        }

        //Another example real service to use against wsd2java script
        stockQuoteClient {
            wsdl = "http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx?WSDL"

            clientInterface = net.webservicex.StockQuoteSoap
            serviceEndpointAddress = "http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx"
        }
    }
}
```

You have the ability to provide wsdl2java custom args.  This is done through the wsdlArgs param.  You may provide this in list format or for a single param in string format.

```groovy
cxf {
    client {
        simpleServiceClient {
            //used in wsdl2java
            wsdl = "docs/SimpleService.wsdl" //only used for wsdl2java script target
            wsdlArgs = ['-autoNameResolution', '-validate']
            //wsdlArgs = '-autoNameResolution' //single param style
            namespace = "cxf.client.demo.simple"
            client = false //defaults to false
            bindingFile = "grails-app/conf/bindings.xml"
            outputDir = "src/java"

            //used for invoking service
            clientInterface = cxf.client.demo.simple.SimpleServicePortType
            serviceEndpointAddress = "${service.simple.url}"
        }
    }
}
```

You may need to use the interface rather than the port type to make your client work:

    ...
    clientInterface = cxf.client.demo.simple.SimpleInterface
    ...

In Grails 3 the default config has changed to YAML.  The following is an example of configured clients with interceptors and other features:

``` yaml

    client:
        simpleServiceClient:
            wsdl: docs/SimpleService.wsdl

	}

	customAuthorizationPolicy(AuthorizationPolicy) {
		userName = 'wsuser'
		password = 'secret'
		authorizationType = 'Basic'
	}
}
```

Note: The [wsdl] node is only used by the wsdl2java target and are not used in wiring the beans at runtime.

After adding the [wsdl] node I can now run the following grails command to generate the cxf/jaxb classes into the src/main/java directory of the project:

    grails wsdl-to-java

The following will also work

    gradle wsdlToJava

WsdlToJava MANUALLY
----------------

If you already have a wsdl2java generated object graph and client proxy you can skip this section.

You must be somewhat familiar with how to run wsdl2java.  Run something like the following command to generate jaxb objects and a service proxy adapter Replacing the paths with the something that is applicable for you.  Run this by either having wsdl2java in your path or from the bin of the apache cxf project

    wsdl2java -compile -client -d [output path] [path to wsdl]

here is my string (I have my wsdl manually saved to a wsdl file in the current working dir)

    C:\projects\cxf-client-demo\docs>c:\apps\apache-cxf-2.4.2\bin\wsdl2java -compile -client -d . -p cxf.client.demo.complex ComplexService.wsdl

I then jar up the files to a complex-service-cxf.jar

    C:\projects\cxf-client-demo\docs>jar -cvf complex-service-cxf.jar cxf

Put the jar into your project's lib dir (and generate any more jars you need).  In my case I need to create another for the Simple Service.

    C:\projects\cxf-client-demo\docs>c:\apps\apache-cxf-2.4.2\bin\wsdl2java -compile -client -d . -p cxf.client.demo.simple SimpleService.wsdl
    C:\projects\cxf-client-demo\docs>jar -cvf simple-service-cxf.jar cxf

Note: These could be put in the same jar since the namespace I am using is different cxf.client.demo.complex and cxf.client.demo.simple.

PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
----------------

To wire up the plugin simple install the plugin via:

    grails install-plugin cxf-client

or from the source code you could also package and install from a zip.

Once the plugin is installed and you have your jaxb objects and cxf client port interface in your path (lib or src), you need to add the following to the Config.groovy of your project:

    cxf:
        client:
            [beanName]:

If you set this to a value then the username and password fields will be ignored as it is expected that you will configure any required property injection in your resources.groovy file.  You may also provide your custom security

This can also be a single string value such as "-autoNameResolution", but when using multiple custom params you must specify each in a list ["-one val","-two","-three val"] due to limitations with ant. (default: "")</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>namespace</td><td>Specifies package names to use for the generated code. (default: "use wsdl provided schema")</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>client</td><td>Used to tell wsdl2java to output sample clients, usually not needed. (default: false)</td><td>No</td></tr>

</table>



You simply refer to your client beans from a controller/service/taglib like the following:

```groovy
class DemoController {
    SimpleServicePortType simpleServiceClient
    ComplexServicePortType complexServiceClient

    def simpleServiceDemo = {
        SimpleRequest request = new SimpleRequest(age: 100, name: "Bob")
        SimpleResponse response = simpleServiceClient.simpleMethod(request)

        render(view: '/index', model: [simpleRequest: request, simpleResponse: response])
    }
}
```

_**NOTE:** You should type the beans with the cxf port interface type so as to get intellisense auto-completion on the service methods. By simply using def you will not know what methods are available on the soap service without peaking into the wsdl or generated client port interface manually._

MIME ATTACHMENTS
----------------
Functionality was recently added by Kyle Dickerson to support mime type attachements in a response.  To do this you will need to set both the _wsdl_ and _wsdlServiceName_ properties.  This is done so that cxf will be able to resolve correctly the attachment data against the wsdl.  If you fail to set these you may cause an IndexOutOfBounds thrown from cxf.  You may need to define _wsdlEndpointName_ as well.

CUSTOM SECURITY INTERCEPTORS
---------------

As a convenience to the user I created an interface to inherit from that allows you to customize the specifics of the interceptor without having to inherit all the contract methods for the cxf interceptors.  You simply have to inherit from CxfClientInterceptor in the org.grails.cxf.client.security package.  Here is the custom interceptor I created for the demo project.

```groovy
package org.grails.cxf.client.security

import org.apache.cxf.ws.security.wss4j.WSS4JOutInterceptor
import org.apache.wss4j.common.ext.WSPasswordCallback
import org.apache.wss4j.dom.WSConstants
import org.apache.wss4j.dom.handler.WSHandlerConstants
import org.grails.cxf.client.CxfClientInterceptor
import org.grails.cxf.client.exception.CxfClientException

import javax.security.auth.callback.Callback
import javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler
import javax.security.auth.callback.UnsupportedCallbackException

class DefaultSecurityOutInterceptor implements CxfClientInterceptor {

    String password
    String username

    WSS4JOutInterceptor create() {
        if(!username?.trim() || !password) {
            throw new CxfClientException('Username and password are not configured for calling secure web services')
        }

        Map<String, Object> outProps = [:]
        outProps.put(WSHandlerConstants.ACTION, WSHandlerConstants.USERNAME_TOKEN)
        outProps.put(WSHandlerConstants.USER, username)
        outProps.put(WSHandlerConstants.PASSWORD_TYPE, WSConstants.PW_TEXT)
        outProps.put(WSHandlerConstants.PW_CALLBACK_REF, new CallbackHandler() {

            void handle(Callback[] callbacks) throws IOException, UnsupportedCallbackException {
                WSPasswordCallback pc = callbacks[0]
                pc.password = password
            }
        })
        new WSS4JOutInterceptor(outProps)
    }
}

```

You have to make sure your create method returns an object that already inherits from the appropriate classes such as an WSS4JOutInterceptor as I used here.  It is technically possible for your interceptor to extend something like SoapHeaderInterceptor, you will just be responsible for overriding all the appropriate methods yourself.  You can see the <a href="http://www.technipelago.se/content/technipelago/blog/basic-authentication-grails-cxf">following example</a> on how to define a basic auth interceptor on the server side.
More specifically refer to <a href="http://chrisdail.com/download/BasicAuthAuthorizationInterceptor.java">this file</a> for sample code on create your own interceptor or to the <a href="https://github.com/Grails-Plugin-Consortium/grails-cxf-client-demo/blob/master/grails-app/conf/BootStrap.groovy">demo project file</a> that injects a server side interceptor. Perhaps the <B>best documentation</b> on writing a complex interceptor can be found at the <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/docs/interceptors.html">Apache CXF</a> site.

In the case of the above CustomSecurityInterceptor, you would then place the following in your projects resources.groovy.

```groovy
beans = {
	myCustomerSecurityOutInterceptor(DefaultSecurityOutInterceptor){
        username = 'wsuser'
        password = 'password'
    }
}
```

The last step to hooking up the custom interceptor is to define the securityInterceptor for the client config block.  The myCustomInterceptor bean can be hooked up by adding the line in the config below.

```yaml
cxf:
    client:
        customSecureServiceClient:
            wsdl: docs/SecureService.wsdl
            namespace: cxf.client.demo.secure
            clientInterface: cxf.client.demo.secure.SecureServicePortType
            secured: true
            securityInterceptor: myCustomerSecurityOutInterceptor
            serviceEndpointAddress: http://localhost:8080/services/secure
```

<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<a name="In"></a>
CUSTOM IN INTERCEPTORS
---------------

You can wire in your own custom in interceptors by adding the property inInterceptors to the configured client.  In this example I have chosen to wire in my own in logging interceptors and have disabled the default logging interceptors by setting enableDefaultLoggingInterceptors = false.

In the resources.groovy define our bean wiring.

```groovy
customLoggingInInterceptor(CustomLoggingInInterceptor) {
    name = "customLoggingInInterceptor"
}

verboseLoggingInInterceptor(VerboseCustomLoggingInInterceptor) {
    name = "verboseLoggingInInterceptor"
}

 customLoggingOutInterceptor(CustomLoggingOutInterceptor) {
    name = "customLoggingOutInterceptor"
}
```

In the Config.groovy cxf { client { ... } } block define a webservice client and provide the interceptor bean name(s).

```yaml
cxf:
  client:
      simpleServiceInterceptorClient:
          wsdl: docs/SimpleService.wsdl #only used for wsdl2java script target
          clientInterface: cxf.client.demo.simple.SimpleServicePortType
          serviceEndpointAddress: http://localhost:8080/services/simple
          outInterceptors: customLoggingOutInterceptor #can use single item, comma separated list or groovy list
          inInterceptors:
            - customLoggingInInterceptor
            - verboseLoggingInInterceptor
          enableDefaultLoggingInterceptors: false
          namespace: cxf.client.demo.simple

```

Here is the code for my customLoggingInInterceptor (verboseLoggingInInterceptor is almost identical)

```groovy
package com.cxf.demo.logging

import org.apache.cxf.common.injection.NoJSR250Annotations
import org.apache.cxf.common.logging.LogUtils
import org.apache.cxf.interceptor.AbstractLoggingInterceptor
import org.apache.cxf.interceptor.Fault
import org.apache.cxf.message.Message
import org.apache.cxf.phase.Phase

import java.util.logging.Logger

/**
 *
 */
@NoJSR250Annotations
public class CustomLoggingInInterceptor extends AbstractLoggingInterceptor {

	private static final Logger LOG = LogUtils.getLogger(CustomLoggingInInterceptor)
	def name
	//SimpleServicePortType simpleServiceClient

	public CustomLoggingInInterceptor() {
		super(Phase.RECEIVE);
		log LOG, "Creating the custom interceptor bean"
	}

	public void handleMessage(Message message) throws Fault {
		//get another web service bean here by name and call it
//        SimpleServicePortType simpleServiceClient = ApplicationHolder.application.mainContext.getBean("simpleServiceClient")
//        log LOG, "status is " + simpleServiceClient.simpleMethod1(new cxf.client.demo.simple.SimpleRequest(age: 30, name: 'Test')).status
		log LOG, "$name :: I AM IN CUSTOM IN LOGGER!!!!!!!"
	}

	@Override
	protected Logger getLogger() {
		LOG
	}
}
```

_**NOTE:** In your constructor you will need to be mindful what Phase you set your interceptor for.  Please see the docs at <http://cxf.apache.org/docs/interceptors.html>_

You will need to set the logging level in the log4j config section to enable the logging

```groovy
info 'org.grails.cxf.client'
info 'org.apache.cxf.interceptor'
info 'blah.blah.blah' //whatever package your custom interceptors are in
//debug 'org.apache.cxf.interceptor' //choose appropriate level
```

<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<a name="Out"></a>
CUSTOM OUT INTERCEPTORS
---------------
You can wire in your own custom out interceptors by adding the property outInterceptors to the configured client.  In this example I have chosen to wire in my own out logging interceptors.

```yaml
cxf:
    client:
        simpleServiceInterceptorClient:
            wsdl: docs/SimpleService.wsdl #only used for wsdl2java script target
            clientInterface: cxf.client.demo.simple.SimpleServicePortType
            serviceEndpointAddress: http://localhost:8080/services/simple
            outInterceptors: customLoggingOutInterceptor #can use single item, comma separated list or groovy list
            inInterceptors:
              - customLoggingInInterceptor
              - verboseLoggingInInterceptor
            enableDefaultLoggingInterceptors: false
            namespace: cxf.client.demo.simple

```

Here is the code for my customLoggingOutInterceptor

```groovy
package com.cxf.demo.logging

import org.apache.cxf.common.injection.NoJSR250Annotations
import org.apache.cxf.common.logging.LogUtils
import org.apache.cxf.interceptor.AbstractLoggingInterceptor
import org.apache.cxf.interceptor.Fault
import org.apache.cxf.message.Message
import org.apache.cxf.phase.Phase

import java.util.logging.Logger

/**
 *
 */
@NoJSR250Annotations
public class CustomLoggingOutInterceptor extends AbstractLoggingInterceptor {

	private static final Logger LOG = LogUtils.getLogger(CustomLoggingOutInterceptor)
	def name

	public CustomLoggingOutInterceptor() {
		super(Phase.WRITE);
		log LOG, "Creating the custom interceptor bean"
	}

	public void handleMessage(Message message) throws Fault {
		log LOG, "$name :: I AM IN CUSTOM OUT LOGGER!!!!!!!"
	}

	@Override
	protected Logger getLogger() {
		LOG
	}
}
```

**Note:** Since the out interceptor is in PRE_STREAM phase (but PRE_STREAM phase is removed in MESSAGE mode), you have to configure out interceptors to be run at write phase.

**Note:** In your constructor you will need to be mindful what Phase you set your interceptor for.  Please see the docs at <http://cxf.apache.org/docs/interceptors.html>

You will need to set the logging level in the log4j config section to enable the logging

```groovy
info 'org.grails.cxf.client'
info 'org.apache.cxf.interceptor'
info 'blah.blah.blah' //whatever package your custom interceptors are in
//debug 'org.apache.cxf.interceptor' //choose appropriate level
```

<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<a name="InFault"></a>
CUSTOM IN FAULT INTERCEPTORS
---------------

You can wire in your own custom in fault interceptors by adding the property inFaultInterceptors to the configured client.  Example coming soon, but should be similar to the earlier two examples.

You will need to set the logging level in the log4j config section to enable the logging

```groovy
info 'org.grails.cxf.client'
info 'org.apache.cxf.interceptor'
info 'blah.blah.blah' //whatever package your custom interceptors are in
//debug 'org.apache.cxf.interceptor' //choose appropriate level
```

CUSTOM OUT FAULT INTERCEPTORS
---------------

You can wire in your own custom out fault interceptors by adding the property outFaultInterceptors to the configured client.  Example coming soon, but should be similar to the earlier two examples.

//debug 'org.apache.cxf.interceptor' //choose appropriate level
```

<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<a name="Custom"></a>
CUSTOM HTTP CLIENT POLICY
---------------

If you simply need to set the connectionTimeout, receiveTimeout, or allowChunking you may use the three provided params to accomplish this.  If you require more fine grained control of the HTTPClientPolicy you can create a custom bean in the resources.groovy and tell your cxf client to use it via the code below.

_Note: A configured httpClientPolicy will take precedence over the connection, connectionTimeout, receiveTimeout and allowChunking. Setting all four params in the config will cause the httpClientPolicy to be used and the others ignored._

resources.groovy

```groovy
beans = {
    customHttpClientPolicy(HTTPClientPolicy){
        connectionTimeout = 30000
        receiveTimeout = 60000
        allowChunking = false
        autoRedirect = false
        connection = org.apache.cxf.transports.http.configuration.ConnectionType.KEEP_ALIVE
    }
}
```

Config.groovy

```yaml
cxf:
    client:
        simpleServiceClient:
            wsdl: docs/SimpleService.wsdl
            wsdlArgs: -autoNameResolution
            clientInterface: cxf.client.demo.simple.SimpleServicePortType
            serviceEndpointAddress: http://localhost:8080/services/simple
            namespace: cxf.client.demo.simple
            httpClientPolicy: customHttpClientPolicy

```

Note: If you incorrectly refer to your new beans name (spelling, etc) you will get an exception such as `...Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No bean named 'blahblah' is defined` error.

<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<a name="CustomAuth"></a>
CUSTOM AUTHORIZATION POLICY
---------------

If you simply need to set Authorization Policy you can create a custom bean in the resources.groovy and tell your cxf client to use it via the code below.
resources.groovy

```groovy
beans = {
    customAuthorizationPolicy(AuthorizationPolicy){
        userName = 'user'
        password = 'password'
    }
}
```

Config.groovy

```groovy
cxf:
    client:
        customSecureAuthorizationServiceClient:
            wsdl: docs/AuthorizationService.wsdl
            clientInterface: cxf.client.demo.authorization.AuthorizationServicePortType
            serviceEndpointAddress: http://localhost:8080/services/authorization
            namespace: cxf.client.demo.authorization
            authorizationPolicy: customAuthorizationPolicy
```

Note: If you incorrectly refer to your new beans name (spelling, etc) you will get an exception such as `...Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No bean named 'blahblah' is defined` error.

<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<a name="Exceptions"></a>
DEALING WITH EXCEPTIONS
---------------
As of version 1.2.9 of the plugin, I have fixed the issue so your services with checked exceptions defined will not throw them as designed.  Given some service that throws an exception (ComplexContrivedException_Exception in our case) as follows:

```java
@WebResult(name = "return", targetNamespace = "")
@RequestWrapper(localName = "complexMethod3", targetNamespace = "http://demo.client.cxf/", className = "cxf.client.demo.complex.ComplexMethod3")
@WebMethod
@ResponseWrapper(localName = "complexMethod3Response", targetNamespace = "http://demo.client.cxf/", className = "cxf.client.demo.complex.ComplexMethod3Response")
public cxf.client.demo.complex.ComplexResponse complexMethod3(
    @WebParam(name = "request", targetNamespace = "")
    cxf.client.demo.complex.ComplexRequest request
) throws ComplexContrivedException_Exception;
```

the checked exceptions can now be caught in code and dealt with as desired:

```groovy
try {
    response1 = complexServiceClient.complexMethod3(request1)
} catch (ComplexContrivedException_Exception e) {
    log.error e
}
```

In addition, any general SOAPFaultException thrown can be caught as well.

```groovy
try {
    response1 = complexServiceClient.complexMethod3(request1)
} catch (ComplexContrivedException_Exception e) {
    log.error e
} catch (SOAPFaultException e) {
    log.error e
}
```

<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<a name="Ssl"></a>
SETTING SECURE SOCKET PROTOCOL
---------------

**TODO: Not supported in grails 3 yet!**

If you would like to set the secure socket protocol for a secure service you can use the `CxfClientConstants` class to set the bean constructor.  The types provided are:

```groovy
public static final String SSL_PROTOCOL_TLSV1 = 'TLSv1'
public static final String SSL_PROTOCOL_SSLV3 = 'SSLv3'
```

You may also provide configuration for via the tlsClientParameters for the client.  Using this you can set any of the following:

disableCNCheck: [boolean]
sslCacheTimeout: [integer]
secureSocketProtocol: [CxfClientConstants.SSL_PROTOCOL_SSLV3]
useHttpsURLConnectionDefaultSslSocketFactory: [boolean]
useHttpsURLConnectionDefaultHostnameVerifier: [boolean]
cipherSuitesFilter.exclude: [List<String>]
cipherSuitesFilter.include: [List<String>]

This is done via the configuration block such as:

Config.groovy

```groovy
cxf {
    client {
        simpleServiceClient {
            ...
            tlsClientParameters = [
                disableCNCheck: true,
                sslCacheTimeout: 100,
                secureSocketProtocol: CxfClientConstants.SSL_PROTOCOL_SSLV3
                cipherSuitesFilter.include = ['.*_EXPORT_.*','.*_EXPORT1024_.*']
                cipherSuitesFilter.exclude = ['.*_DH_anon_.*']
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Either may be used, but the secureSocketProtocol takes precedent for setting the protocol.  Both `secureSocketProtocol` and `tlsClientParameters` may be used in conjunction, but it is preferred if you want to set more than just the protocol to use the tlsClientParameters map.

Not all features for http conduit are supported.  You can read more about conduit settings at <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CXF20DOC/TLS+Configuration>.

<a name="Beans"></a>
USING CLIENT BEANS ANYWHERE
---------------
If you require useage of the web service clients you can access them anywhere by accessing them by name.  The name of the bean will match the name of the configured client in your Config.groovy.

<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<a name="Endpoints"></a>
RETRIEVING AND UPDATING ENDPOINTS
---------------
The service endpoint address for any given service can be retrieved and updated at runtime using the WebserviceClientFactory interface.

I have synchronized the access to update address method to ensure thread safe access to the underlying service map.  The method signature is as follows:

```groovy
@Synchronized void updateServiceEndpointAddress(String serviceName, String serviceEndpointAddress) throws UpdateServiceEndpointException
```

To retrieve an endpoint via code:

```groovy
WebserviceClientFactory webserviceClientFactory

String endpointAddress = webserviceClientFactory.getServiceEndpointAddress('simpleServiceClient')
```

To update an endpoint:

```groovy
WebserviceClientFactory webserviceClientFactory

webserviceClientFactory.updateServiceEndpointAddress('simpleServiceClient', 'http://www.changeme.com/services/newURL')
```

If no service endpoint is found matching the `serviceName` or if an empty name is passed, an UpdateServiceEndpointException will be thrown.  This was done to give concrete feedback of an endpoint update failure.

ENABLING LOGGING OF SOAP MESSAGES
---------------

**Todo: Update for grails 3**

If you would like to view the raw soap in the console/log files add the follow:

JVM startup params:
```
-Dorg.apache.cxf.Logger=org.apache.cxf.common.logging.Log4jLogger
```

Logging config:
```groovy
log4j {
    ...
  info 'org.apache.cxf' //debug, etc
}
```

ISSUES
---------------

To submit an issue please use <https://github.com/Grails-Plugin-Consortium/grails-cxf-client/issues>.

Currently there is an issue with pointing to a secure endpoint and running the wsdl2java script.  If you get an error message like

    PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target

You may need to put a cert into your [jdkhome]\jre\lib\security directory.  I will be working on getting this working working by adding the cert to the service end point configuration in an upcoming release.

Another solution is to get the wsdl from the web and copy into a local file.wsdl and change the config to point to a local file instead of the https endpoint for generation.

If your compile fails on the Client classes you may need to add

```
wsdlArgs = ['-autoNameResolution','-frontend','jaxws21']
```

to your service args.  The autoNameResolution to resolve duplicate or recursive entries in the wsdl and the frontend set to jaxws21 to force the generated classes to conform with 2.1 standards.

WSDL2JAVA

It appears there was a change that caused classpath issues with the ant wsdl2java tools.  If this fails to run you can upgrade to version 1.6.1+ of the plugin or add the following into your dependencies block of your project.

```
compile("${cxfGroup}:cxf-tools-wsdlto-core:${cxfVersion}") {
    excludes 'xmlbeans', 'spring-web', 'spring-core', 'xml-apis'
}

compile("${cxfGroup}:cxf-tools-wsdlto-frontend-jaxws:${cxfVersion}") {
    excludes 'xmlbeans', 'spring-web', 'spring-core', 'xml-apis'
}

compile("${cxfGroup}:cxf-tools-wsdlto-databinding-jaxb:${cxfVersion}") {
    excludes 'xmlbeans', 'spring-web', 'spring-core', 'xml-apis'
}
```
